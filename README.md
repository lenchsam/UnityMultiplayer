## About
This project was created for my university module Multiplayer Mechanics Programming. In this module we got tasked with creating a multiplayer game of our choice that focused around a specific mechanic in the unity game engine. We had 8 weeks to go from minimal networking knowledge, to creating this game prototype. The prototype I chose to make focused around lighting up lights and shooting enemies. There is a maximum of 2 players, where player 1 can shoot and see lights, player 2 can light up the lights but can only see them when player 1 is close to them. Player 1 has to protect player 2 as player 2 cannot shoot.
